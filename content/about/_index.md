Software engineering grad from @[Unison](http://www.uson.mx/) (2011 - 2016). I currently find myself as a freelance front-end web developer, mostly working on [wordpress](https://wordpress.org/), but I'm always excited about new challenges.  
Accomplished my internship program developing an online course platform for ~~[Soluciones Verdes](https://www.solucionesverdes.com.mx/ "Site currently down")~~, using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/).
